Issues
-------------------
You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? You can help us by `submitting an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/NxSys/library.clients-brex/issues>`_. Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible*. Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific.* Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- *Unique.* Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- *Scoped to a Single Bug.* One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
