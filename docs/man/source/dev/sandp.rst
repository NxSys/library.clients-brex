On Sonar
-------------------
https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=NxSys_library.clients-brex

We use sonar to ensure a high level of code quality. Please ensure that new code passes the appropriate `quality gates <https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/nxsys/quality_gates/show/4780>`_. You may choose to familiarize yourself with `our rule set <https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/nxsys/quality_profiles/show?name=ONX+way&language=php>`_. It is also recommended to add `Sonar directly into your ide as a linter <https://open-vsx.org/extension/SonarSource/sonarlint-vscode>`_.

Style Guide
-------------------
Review 'smells' here:

.. note:: See tabs in code that don't quite line up? Consider adding `Elastic Tabstops <https://open-vsx.org/extension/ONXGroup/elastic-tabstops-mono>`_ to your IDE.

Conventions
-------------------
Please use `PAHN <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/PHP_Programming/Alternative_Hungarian_Notation>`_ as common sense allows.

Policies
-------------------
Please note that we have a `code of conduct <https://github.com/NxSys/library.clients-brex/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_. Please follow it in all your interactions with this project.
