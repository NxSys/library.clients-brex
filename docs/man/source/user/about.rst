What is Brex?
-------------
`Brex <https://www.brex.com/>`_  is a fin-tech company that offers a variety of financial products. That includes bank accounts, transfers, corporate cards, vendor management & bill pay, ERP integrations, and more.

What is this?
-------------
The `Brex SDK for PHP <https://packagist.org/packages/nxsys/library.clients-brex>`_ is an installable composer package that allows an application to call on the `Brex API <https://developer.brex.com/>`_ through PHP.

Why is this?
------------
The `Brex API <https://developer.brex.com/>`_ allows you to do specific actions, custom actions, and bulk actions on your Brex account. It is also a moderately sized application that consists of 6 different relevant endpoints that connect with a variety of entities and calls supported on each one. This SDK allows you to call any portion of that API in a PHP runtime environment in a structured and object-oriented way without worrying about REST particulars or being concerned with a particular HTTP implementation.

How does this work?
-------------------
This SDK marshals access to the entire API through a single host object. We leverage code generation through `Jane PHP <https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_  to consume the published OpenAPI specification of Brex's API. Additionally we're able to use `HTTPlug <http://httplug.io/>`_ to allow our generated code to support an HTTP request client you may already be using through auto-discovery. Note: A default implementation of `Symfony's HTTP Client <https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html#psr-18-and-psr-17>`_ is suggested and is discussed here (:ref:`autoclient`), if you are not already using one.
