Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
Install `nxsys/library.client-brex <https://packagist.org/packages/nxsys/library.clients-brex>`_ with `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos>`_.

.. code-block::

	composer require nxsys/library.client-brex

And please don't forget

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

Getting a Token From Brex
-------------------------

For consumer accounts, you will need an API token from Brex. Instructions for getting that token can be found on Brexâ€™s developer website:

https://developer.brex.com/docs/authentication/

Please ensure that you select the necessary amount of scopes for your application to function. This will also ensure that you mitigate information leakage and have fewer attack surfaces.

This library has no minimum scope requirements.

.. _autoclient:

PSR-7 HTTP Client
-----------------
This library allows you to keep the HTTP client library you may already be using in your application; it does this through `service discovery <https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/discovery.html>`_. If you are not using an `PSR-7 aware HTTP client <https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/message/message-factory.html>`_, then you will need to `install one <https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation>`_.


Install the package below.

.. _code:
.. code-block::

    composer require symfony/http-client

We have tested this against `Symfony's Http Client <https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html>`_ which bundles a client and appropriate factories (`nyholm/psr7 <https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7>`_).

.. note:: If this is confusing please read https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html and don't hesitate to `chat with us <https://onx.zulipchat.com>`_!



Calling the API
----------------

Calling this library is fairly straightforward. You can jump right in without requiring too much boilerplate. We like simplicity!

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	#if using composer use the autoloader
	require 'vendor\autoload.php';

	use NxSys\Library\Clients\Brex as BrexSdk;

	$oSDK=new BrexSdk\SDKHost;

	//Let's get company details to start
	$oTeamClient=$oSDK->setAuthKey('BREX TOKEN') #consider using a token vault
		->setupTeamClient();

	/** @var BrexSdk\API\Team\Client */
	$oTeamClient;

	//... OR
	//if you will be doing work across the API, use the following convenience method
	$oTeamClient=$oSDK->setupAllClients()->getTeamClient();

	/** @var BrexSdk\API\Team\Model\CompanyResponse */
	$aCompanyDetails=$oTeamClient->getCompany();

	$sCompanyName=$aCompanyDetails->getLegalName();
	// ACME Corp, Inc.
