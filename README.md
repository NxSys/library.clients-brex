This is a SDK to allow PHP projects to quickly use the Brex REST API <URL> to accomplish all common banking tasks available from the API. Through [code generation](https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest) we currently support full API coverage.

You will, of course, need to be a Brex client to get any use from this library.

CAUTION: This is financial software. The nature of the Brex API means that most usage will involve dealing with highly sensitive financial data and money transfers. You are entirely responsible for ensuring that proper security measures are implemented to protect all data. Please observe the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) (and its *disclaimer*) and thoroughly understand [SECURITY](SECURITY.md) (and the limitations of this implementation).



## Getting Started

### Requirements
* [A Brex Account](https://www.brex.com/sales)
* PHP 8.1
* Composer
* A [library that implements PSR7](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation)

### Installation
Install `nxsys/library.client-brex` with composer.

```bash
composer require nxsys/library.client-brex
```
This library allows you to keep the http client library you may already
be using in your application. It does this through HTTP DISCOVERY DOCS.
If you are not using an HTTP CLIENT you will need to install one.

We have tested this against GuzzlePHP. Install the PKG PKG and PKG below.

    composer require php-http/curl-client guzzlehttp/psr7 php-http/message
@SEE FAQ DOCS & https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html
## Usage/Examples

```php
<?php
#if using composer use the autoloader
require 'vendors\autoload.php';

use NxSys\Library\Clients\Brex\SdkClient;
use NxSys\Library\Clients\Brex\API as BrexApi;

$oSDK=new SdkClient('BREX TOKEN'); #consider using a token vault

//Initializes Endpoints
$oSDK->setupClient();

//Lets get company details to start
$oTeamClient=$oSDK->getTeamClient();

/** @var BrexApi\Team\Model\CompanyResponse */
$aCompanyDetails=$oTeamClient->getCompany();

$sCompanyName=$aCompanyDetails->getLegalName();
// ACME Corp, Inc.
```
