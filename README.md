This is an SDK to allow PHP applications to quickly use the Brex [REST API](https://developer.brex.com/) to accomplish all common banking tasks available from the API. Through [code generation](https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest) we currently support full API coverage.

You will, of course, [need to be a Brex client](https://www.brex.com/sales) to get any use from this library.

CAUTION: This is financial software. The nature of the Brex API means that most usage will involve dealing with highly sensitive financial data and/or money transfers. You are entirely responsible for ensuring that proper security measures are implemented to protect your property (money and information). Please observe the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) (and its *disclaimer*), and thoroughly understand [SECURITY](SECURITY.md) (and the limitations of this implementation).



## Getting Started

### Requirements
* [A Brex Account](https://www.brex.com/sales)
* [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
* A [library that implements PSR7](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation)

### Installation
Install `nxsys/library.client-brex` with composer.

```bash
composer require nxsys/library.client-brex
```
This library allows you to keep the http client library you may already
be using in your application. It does this through [service discovery](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/discovery.html).
If you are not using an [PSR-7 aware HTTP client](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/message/message-factory.html) you will need to [install one](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation).

We have tested this against [Symfony's HTTP Client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html). Install the package below.

    composer require symfony/http-client

>If this is confusing please read https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html and don't hesitate to [chat with us](https://onx.zulipchat.com)!

## Usage/Examples

```php
<?php
#if using composer use the autoloader
require 'vendor\autoload.php';

use NxSys\Library\Clients\Brex as BrexSdk;

$oSDK=new BrexSdk\SDKHost;

//Let's get company details to start
$oTeamClient=$oSDK->setAuthKey('BREX TOKEN') #consider using a token vault
	->setupTeamClient();

/** @var BrexSdk\API\Team\Client */
$oTeamClient;

//... OR
//if you will be doing work across the API, use the follow convenience method
$oTeamClient=$oSDK->setupAllClients()->getTeamClient();
//etc...

/** @var BrexSdk\API\Team\Model\CompanyResponse */
$aCompanyDetails=$oTeamClient->getCompany();

$sCompanyName=$aCompanyDetails->getLegalName();
// ACME Corp, Inc.
```
