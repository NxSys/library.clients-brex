# Security Policy

## Operational Risks
As stated in the README. This software's purpose is to touch your *company's* money. It can read your transactions, add users to your account, and create expense cards. This is *inherently risky and sensitive*. Additionally this library is a point-to-point tool and has no access control of any kind. Moreover this is open source and freely available software. It is therefore impossible for the authors to make assurances about your security without investigating your unique environment. It is incumbent upon you, dear developer, to make well considered and careful judgments about exactly if, and how, you implement this software. While standing firmly on our disclaimer, we wish you Godspeed.

## Mitigation
Universal Recommendations
* Don't take chances with user access.
* Don't needlessly expose login interfaces and tokens.
* Check your statements and logs regularly.
* Investigate unusual activity.
  Prompt action may prevent a minor incident from turning in to a serious one!
* Use secure channels whenever possible.

BE SURE YOU'RE SECURE
